Bubble Bobble is a classic arcade-style, action platformer made and published by Taito. It was first launched for arcades in 1986, and then for a great number of home consoles like the NES.

Join Bub and Bob, two lovable dragons, on their quest to rescue their girlfriends from the clutches of the evil wizard, Baron von Blubba. To save the day, you must navigate through a series of increasingly challenging levels filled with enemies and obstacles.

Use Bub and Bob's unique ability to blow bubbles to trap enemies and then burst them to defeat them. But be careful, if you're not quick enough, the bubbles can pop on their own, releasing the enemies trapped inside!

Each level presents new challenges and surprises, from tricky enemy patterns to cleverly hidden secrets. Collect power-ups along the way to enhance your bubble-bursting abilities and increase your chances of success.
